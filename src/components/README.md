# Components

Components provide individual `serverless` projects which may be separately compiled and deployed as-needed. They allow us to decrease deploy time and separate concerns. Care should be taken when considering where to add various pieces of your infrastructure.

> We don't want to be concerned that `x` breaks whenever we deploy `y`.
