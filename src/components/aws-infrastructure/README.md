# aws-infrastructure

This project contains the critical core infrastructure buildout required for the application to run. It is separated from the other pieces so that each deploy does not need to be concerned with breaking these pieces of the infrastructure. It will provision things such as the VPC, EC2 Instances,Databases, etc.
